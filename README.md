# Conway's Game of Life
An implementation of Conway's Game of Life created for Computer Science 121 at Ball State University.

This code is meant for practice of Java, classes, and possibly Swing and Javadocs.  

While it has no significant purpose, you may download, use, print, modify, commercialize, cook, eat, destroy, microwave, breastfeed, harass, mourn, sing, or otherwise do whatever you want to this code.  Just remember that I take no responsibility for the results, good or bad, of the results of any of these things.
